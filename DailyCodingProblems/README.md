Problem Descriptions:
<br />[1.](Problems/Problem1/src/problem1/Problem1.java) Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k
<br />[2.](Problems/Problem2/src/problem2/Problem2.java) Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
<br />[3.](Problems/Problem3/src/problem3/Problem3.java) Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space
<br />[4.](Problems/Problem4/src/problem4/Problem4.java) Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
<br />[5.](Problems/Problem5/src/problem5/Problem5.java) Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers.
<br />[6.](Problems/Problem6/src/problem6/Problem6.java) There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways to climb the staircase.
<br />[7.](Problems/Problem7/src/problem7/Problem7.java) Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
<br />[8.](Problems/Problem8/src/problem8/Problem8.java) You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:
	record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
	get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.
<br />[9.](Problems/Problem9/src/problem9/Problem9.java) A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. 
    <br />He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.
    <br />Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, 
    <br />return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
<br />[10.](Problems/Problem10/src/problem10/Problem10.java) Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.
<br />[11.](Problems/Problem11/src/problem11/Problem11.java) Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.
<br />[12.](Problems/Problem12/src/problem12/Problem12.java) Given a dictionary of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the original sentence in a list.
<br />[13.](Problems/Problem13/src/problem13/Problem13.java) Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list.
<br />[14.](Problems/Problem14/src/problem14/Problem14.java) Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.
<br />[15.](Problems/Problem15/src/problem15/Problem15.java) Text Justification
<br />[16.](Problems/Problem16/src/problem16/Problem16.java) Implement run-length encoding and decoding. 
<br />[17.](Problems/Problem17/src/problem17/Problem17.java) Trapping rain water
