Problem Descriptions:
1. Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k
2. Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
3. Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space
4. Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
5. Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers.
6. There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways to climb the staircase.
7. Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
8. You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:
	record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
	get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.
9. This problem was asked by Facebook.
    A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. 
    He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

    Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, 
    return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
